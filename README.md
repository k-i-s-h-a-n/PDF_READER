# PDF_READER
This program creates a simple application using a window (with buttons and text fields) where you can select a PDF file from your computer. Once you choose a PDF, it opens a new window where you can type in a page number. When you enter a page number and press a button, the program reads the text from that specific page of the PDF file aloud using your computer's speakers. It uses Python and some libraries like tkinter for the graphical interface and PyPDF2 for handling PDFs, making it easier for you to hear the content of a chosen page in a PDF document.
